## Professional
After a bachelor in Computer Science, a master in Human-Media Interaction and a PhD in brain-computer interfaces all at University of Twente, I made the jump to Saxion University of Applied Sciences. Looking for a change from the academic, I initially focused on teaching, but over time I shifted back to research. Now I am associate lector (which is a strange Dutch UAS word for associate professor) at lectorate (research group) Ambient Intelligence.

## Personal
I am married with two kids. Live in an old house with a too large garden. I read and listen to audio books - a lot. In terms of exercise, I jump with my kids at JumpXL, do a bit of yoga, and play active games such as Beat Saber and Ring Fit Adventure. Other main hobbies: singing, gardening, drawing.
