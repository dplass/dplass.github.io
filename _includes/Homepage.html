    <h1>Danny's digital garden</h1>
    
    <p>
        This digital garden hosts the Work-in-Progress notes of Danny Plass.

        Here I want to explain a bit about digital gardens, what to expect from this one, and provide some entry points.

        Jekyll Garden lets you build a digital garden of atomic notes (working notes) using Github pages from your Obsidian vault. 
        Check out <a href="../posts/how-to">Features </a> to know the the theme and, <a href="../posts/how-to"> Install and Setup </a> to know more. 
        Go to <a href="../notes"> notes </a> to see the note feed.
