At the moment I'm mostly involved in teaching at HBO-ICT (called HBO-IT for the international students).
I've taught various courses from Introduction to Programming to Algorithms and Datastructures. At the moment I'm mostly involved in teaching research skills to both students and teachers, and graduation coaching.
