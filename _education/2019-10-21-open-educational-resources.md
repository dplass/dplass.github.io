title: Open Educational Resources (HBO-i)

Existing educational materials on research skills are often (1) aimed at university students, not UAS (hbo) students and (2) too general or aimed at very different domains, making it difficult for IT students to see the relevance to their profession. 
Therefore Esther Hageraats and I started a national HBO-i project in 2017 to jointly develop open educational resources for HBO-IT research skills. The first lessons have become available in 2018, in collaboration with HAN, HHS, Fontys, HU, and of course Saxion.

The educational resources are available on wikiwijs: [hbo-ict-oio.wikiwijs.nl](https://hbo-ict-oio.wikiwijs.nl/)
