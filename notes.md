This is an open collection of work-in-progress notes of literature, explorations, learning and ideas in various stages of readiness (draft, in progress, finished), also known as a [digital garden](public/digital%20garden.html). Contents *will* change over time. New notes or updates to existing notes will appear (almost) daily.
