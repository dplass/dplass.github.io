This is an open collection of work-in-progress notes of literature, explorations, learning and ideas in various stages of readiness (draft, in progress, finished), also known as a [digital garden](/notes/public/digital%20garden.html). Contents *will* change over time. New notes or updates to existing notes will appear (almost) daily. A good starting point is [areas of interest](/notes/public/areas%20of%20interest.html).
