Knowledge management as defined as systems to capture, create, store, distribute and use knowledge [^1]. Personal knowledge management then is such a system for personal use. Wright (2005) adds to this: "to enhance the effectiveness, productivity and innovation of individual workers"[^2]

Personally, I like to think of it more along the lines of the way Ahrens describes it in How to take smart notes (2017)[^3], as **a tool for better thinking through externalization**.

There are various tools for different aspects of PKM. I use [[Obsidian]]. I share some of my notes in a more cleaned-up version in this online [[digital garden]] you are currently visiting.
