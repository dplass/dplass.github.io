This [[digital garden]] contains notes on specific areas of interest related to my work as an associate lector. This allows me to share more about my expertise and ongoing learning about these topics, in the hopes that it may help others as well.

- [[human-computer interaction]], more specifically: [[xr]], [[persuasive technology]] and [[data visualisation]]
- [[project acquisition]]
- [[personal knowledge management]] 
- [[productivity]]
- [[learning]]

If any of these area notes do not exist yet, they will be written over the upcoming month or so. It's a work in progress.
