Learning is one of my passions. I have been in some form of school non-stop since kindergarten ;) I love to learn, whether it is learning how to sing, how to play beat saber at expert+ level, or how to develop optimal [XR] user interfaces. In teaching I have had a broad set of experiences from Introduction to programming to Algorithms and datastructures and Research skills (Curiosity). 

Some of the topics and questions I have started to dive into in this [[digital garden]]:
- How do you become an [[expert]]? 
- How can a [[learning community]] help us in life-long learning?
- What are key concepts in learning (and teaching) that are important to understand? Such as [[threshold concept]]s, [[scaffolding]], but also the productivity-related [[Pareto principle]].

I can thoroughly recommend the books by [Barbara Oakley](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/669905.Barbara_Oakley) on this, specifically:
- [A Mind for Numbers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers), for learners (related to Learning how to Learn on Coursera – Thanks [Almer Tigelaar](https://almer.tigelaar.net/), for pointing me towards that one!)
- [Uncommon Sense Teaching](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55835996-uncommon-sense-teaching), for teachers

They are both very thorough, concrete and hands-on.
