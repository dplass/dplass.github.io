Notes in a [[digital garden]] have different stages of development. 
For my notes, I'm using the same terminology here as [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/), and to stay with the gardening metaphor, they will be accompanied with images showing different stages of growth (similar to what [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) does). The icons are from the [OpenMoji project](https://openmoji.org/library/#group=animals-nature%2Fplant-other), with colors adjusted for the dark theme.

- **note** - the initial seed
- **draft** - has some structure
- **in-progress** - a well-developed draft
- **finished** - done (but contents likely still develop further over time)
