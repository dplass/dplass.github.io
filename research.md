At the Ambient Intelligence research group the general focus is on data science, but how do we make sure that what comes out of that really benefits the users? That is where my Augmented Interaction research line comes in. 

We augment the real-world interactions of users in beneficial ways with the data-science-driven results from the smart systems our research group develops. In turn, we can use these interactions to gather more data, making the systems even smarter. The research line focuses on three areas of expertise: *intuitive interaction, data visualisation and persuasive technology. XR (AR, MR, VR)* is one of the key technologies to realize these interfaces.
