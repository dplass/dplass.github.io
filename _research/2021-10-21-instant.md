In the INSTANT project we develop improved IMUs with accompanying applications to help physical therapists and patients with ACL or KOA.
From a human-computer interaction perspective there are two interesting components to this. The first is to develop a dashboard that helps physical therapists and patients make intuitive sense of highly technical data. The second is to develop a motivating training suite that patients can use by themselves in the gym at the physical therapist.
