In the 1-year KIEM project "Automatische gesprekken t.b.v. optimale stadionbezetting" (automated conversations to achieve optimal stadium occupation) we develop a conversational agent, comparing different solutions, and connect it to existing back-end software to also automatically process follow-up actions based on those conversations. In this project we collaborate with Sports Alliance, Heracles and Feyenoord.
